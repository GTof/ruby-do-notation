Haskell-style monad do-notation for Ruby

By Aanand Prasad (aanand.prasad@gmail.com)

A first attempt, nervous and shaky. It is liable
to drop its cigarette in fear if you look it
too closely in the eye.

Its biggest failing, and I don't see a way
out, is that you don't get lexical scope. ParseTree
is wonderful, but it can't work miracles.

You can work around it, though, by passing in
stuff from the outside as arguments to `run',
and specifying those arguments on the block
you pass in as well.

Examples at the bottom.
